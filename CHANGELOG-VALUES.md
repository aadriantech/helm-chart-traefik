ðŸš¨ When enabling persistence for certificates, permissions on acme.json can be
lost when Traefik restarts. You can ensure correct permissions with an
initContainer. See https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md#use-traefik-native-lets-encrypt-integration-without-cert-manager
for more info. ðŸš¨

### TLS Options and Store

These sections are kept as default, as they are essential for setting up TLS options and stores but do not require specific modifications for your architecture.

### Service Configuration

- Enabled the Traefik service.
- Configured Traefik to use a single service for both TCP and UDP to align with your architecture.
- Set Traefik to use a LoadBalancer, which is essential for integration with MetalLB.
- Added placeholders for annotations to both TCP and UDP services for future use.
- Kept annotationsTCP and annotationsUDP empty for customization if needed.
- Kept labels empty for adding custom labels if needed.
- Kept spec empty for additional entries if needed.
- Left externalTrafficPolicy, loadBalancerIP, and clusterIP as comments for potential configuration.
- Kept loadBalancerSourceRanges empty for security settings.
- Kept externalIPs empty for specifying external IPs if needed.
- Kept additionalServices empty for adding additional internal services if required.

### Autoscaling

Disabled autoscaling as it is not specified in your architecture requirements.

### Persistence

- Disabled persistence as it is not required for Traefik in your architecture.
- Kept other configurations as default with `name: data`, `accessMode: ReadWriteOnce`, `size: 128Mi`, and default path `/data`.

### Cert Resolvers

Kept default configuration for certificate resolvers, no specific modifications required.

### Host Network
